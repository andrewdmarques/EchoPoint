# EchoPoint
EchoPoint is a small mountable device that enables audio playback at the push of a button. What makes this device unique is the portable nature of EchoPoint. A power relay cuts power to all internal electronics when dormant for more than 1 minute, enabling 2+ weeks of museum operation with 1000-1500 button pushes before recharging the batteries.
